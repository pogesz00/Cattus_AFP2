The document starts with the usual HTML5 doctype declaration and sets the language to English.
In the <head> section:
It sets the character encoding to UTF-8.
It includes a viewport meta tag for responsive design.
The <title> tag uses the Blade templating @yield directive to dynamically set the title of the page. If no title is provided in child views, it defaults to "AutoBazaar".
It includes the Bootstrap 5 CSS framework via a CDN link.
It sets the favicon using the asset() function, which suggests this template is part of a Laravel application, as it uses Laravel's asset helper to generate the correct URL for the favicon file.
In the <body> section:
It includes a Blade directive @include('header') to include the header content. This indicates that the header content is stored in a separate Blade view file.
It uses another Blade directive @yield('content') to define a section where the content of child views will be injected. This allows different views to inject their specific content into this layout.
It includes the Bootstrap 5 JavaScript bundle via a CDN link at the end of the body, ensuring that the page's content is loaded before any JavaScript is executed.
